# Using JsonSchemaResolver

This sample uses a [JsonSchemaResolver](/api/newtonsoft/json/schema/jsonschemaresolver/) to resolve schema references from different JSON documents.

:::caution
**Obsolete.** JSON Schema validation has been moved to its own package. See [https://www.newtonsoft.com/jsonschema](https://www.newtonsoft.com/jsonschema) for more details.
